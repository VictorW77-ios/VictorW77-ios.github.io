## Why I chose to become a Software Engineer 


When I was a freshman in college, I thought I had life all figured out. I was going to study hard, take every opportunity thrown my way, and get into the law school of my dreams. I was convinced, or rather, *convicted* by the dreams of my mother who invested so much in me, the stories of my enslaved great-great-*somebody*, and the lady on the bus I rode to my internship who would tell me *everyday* to - "do good because we need you". 

At some point along the road, I started seeing myself as a *black James Bond* clandestinely navigating the halls of heteronormative whiteness to create opportunities for people that looked like me and loved like me. Or in my debate jargon: I began to propogate transformative activism in the legal arena in hopes that that activism would diffuse outward into society-at-large. 


But how did I end up at the Flatiron School?

Well, to my surprise, life didn't pan out the way I believed it ought to!
> *"Ought"*: implying a moral obligation I **demanded** life obey.

I looked up one day and thought, *Who am I doing this for?*, because it clearly wasn't for myself. Even more, would poorly thoughtout morals pay thousands of dollars in student loan debt or change the fact that [lawyers have a 6% job outlook](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/legal/lawyers.htm)? Of course not. 

Yet, this realization didn't make changing careers any easier. I was majoring in Religious Studies and it was the middle of my junior year - how was I supposed to drop something I built my life around for 3 years? And if I did, what would I do instead?

I was confused about so much but I knew 3 things for sure: 

1. I wanted to do something that had the potential to positively impact my community,

2. I needed something challenging because otherwise, I would lose my passion for it, and

3. I wanted unmatched job security because ain't nobody gon' pay *my* bills but me. 

Soon after, I started seeing billboards everywhere! *Flatiron School*; the title of an institution with the promise of making me a competitve Software Engineer within a fraction of the time a bachelors degree would take to finish - 

**If** I worked hard. 
**If** I stayed consistent. 
**If** I was willing to take a leap of faith. 

> I was willing to take a leap of faith.


So, if I'm being honest, Flatiron School was the answer to problems I thought would've never been answered. 

My mom still dreams of having a successful son, I still hear stories of how far we've come as a people, and old ladies still embew me with their aspirations, but every time I code, I am fulfilling both their dreams and my own *on my own terms*; in my own unique way. 

That's why I decided to become a Software Engineer.
